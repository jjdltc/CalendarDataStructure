CalendarDataStructure
=====================

Simple calendar data structure, allow you to

* Get the month data => a weeks array, each one with the data to create every day 
* Get the week data => simplified version of month data, just one week in the array
* Move to the next or past month / week and get that data

__IMPORTANT__ => this is the structure needed to create and navigate in the calendar, but not for decorate it... It just return the array with the info, and allow you to surf future and past in calendar.
